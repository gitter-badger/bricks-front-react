# Lambda Blocks

TODO: Add screenshot


## History of the project

As I was working as a teacher in a bootcamp,
I realized that there is a lot of incidental complexity when someone is learning to program.
This is my attempt of a tool that makes learn to program easier.


There are a lot of visual programming environments,
this project differentiates by 3 main ideas:
- Teaches Functional Programming.
- The connections between blocks are as important as the blocks.
In most of the other projects the connections are just lines.
- The execution flow is from top to bottom, not from left to right like in most projects.


## Development

You need npm installed on your machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lambdablocks/blocks-front-react.git
$ cd blocks-front-react
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Open `localhost:8080` in your browser.
